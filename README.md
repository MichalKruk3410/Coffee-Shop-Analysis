# Coffee-Shop-Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is my first own project simulates a real-life business analytics case for a coffee shop. The goal was to design an end-to-end BI solution: from raw data cleaning and transformation to building an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

The dataset contained around 150,000 transactions, originally provided in a CSV file. After data preparation, the dashboard allows to explore sales patterns, customer preferences, and operational insights.

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation:

- Standardizing text values

- Changing data types

- Replacing inconsistent entries

- Adding a unique transaction ID column

Power BI for modeling and visualization:

- Calculated columns and DAX measures

- Time intelligence functions to analyze best-selling days, hours, and months

- KPI indicators and trend analysis

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Peak Sales Hour: Most products were sold around 10 AM

- Best Sales Day: The top-performing day in the last week was Wednesday

- Customer Preference: The Regular size was the most frequently chosen option

- These findings illustrate how coffee shop managers could optimize staffing, inventory, and promotions based on customer behavior.

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features

The Power BI report includes:

- Line charts to visualize sales over time

- Donut charts for product category breakdown

- Column charts for comparison between time periods

- Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering
